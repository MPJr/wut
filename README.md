# Intro

### This is just a way for me to learn about Git and coding in general.
Just want to learn new things to see if this could become a hobby for me and I enjoy helping people.
I will be using this repository as a way to test things I have learned in the GitHub Learning Lab and from looking around at what other people are doing in their projects. Will also probably use this as a place for some ideas for projects in early planning stages.
